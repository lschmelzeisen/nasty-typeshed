Python `stub files <https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/stubs.html>`_ created
during `NASTY <https://github.com/lschmelzeisen/nasty>`_'s development.

These stub files do not try to be feature complete representations of the original
packages, instead they restrict themselves to just the functionality that I needed at
the time.
In rare cases methods might contain deliberatly false type annotations, to make typing
or usage easier.
